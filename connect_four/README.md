# Connect Four

A prompt from The Odin Project.

Hopefully everyone has played Connect Four at some point,if not, see the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four). It’s a basic game where each player takes turns dropping pieces into the cage. Players win if they manage to get 4 of their pieces consecutively in a row, column, or along a diagonal.

The game rules are fairly straightforward and you’ll be building it on the command line like you did with the other games.

## The Assignment

Build Connect Four and keep it TDD. 

Only write exactly enough code to make your test pass. Oftentimes, you’ll end up having to write two tests in order to make a method do anything useful. That’s okay here. It may feel a bit like overkill, but that’s the point of the exercise. Your thoughts will probably be something like “Okay, I need to make this thing happen. How do I test it? Okay, wrote the test, how do I code it into Ruby? Okay, wrote the Ruby, how can I make this better?” You’ll find yourself spending a fair bit of time Googling and trying to figure out exactly how to test a particular bit of functionality. That’s also okay… You’re really learning RSpec here, not Ruby, and it takes some getting used to.
